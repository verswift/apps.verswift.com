<h2> HTML Version</h2>

<!--this is a comment-->
<ul> I used html 5 because :
<li>It's the latest version  of html</li>
<li>It provides support for games as per the function of my site</li>
<li>Play game submissions by members</li>
</ul>
<p> However, html5 is not supported by older browsers though this shouldn't be a problem as most people use firefox or chrome  and it is clear that support will not be an issue since sites such as youtube rely heavily on the technology.</p>

<h2> CSS Version</h2>
<b>I used  CSS4  for the following reasons:</b>
<ul>
<li>Twice as fast as version 3</li>
<li>Redesigned to allow for separation of the color library - </li>
<li>Redesigned to allow for n</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tools</h2>
<h3>gedit</h3>
<p>I ues this text editor to edit my code. I used it's built in themes to specify the colours of the various elements and use a dark theme to make the code writing process easier and smoother for myself</p>

<h3>Validation</h3>
<p><a href="https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input+with_options"  style="color:white;">  To check my html code, I used the markup validator service from w3c </a> </p>
<p> <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/"  style="color:white;">To check my css code I used the css validator service from w3c</a> </p>

</ul>
</div>

<div class ="box" style="width: 25%;">
<h2>Testing</h2>
<p> I also tested my website of various operating systems such as android, linux and windows</p>
<p> To check my code as I went along, I used google chrome. I was able to edit my code with gedit and reload the webpages to see the effect and thus make changes as necessary </p>
</div>


<div class ="box" style="width: 25%;">
<h2>Features</h2>
<p> The website now has a email and name validator which will be expanded for a newsletter feature. Again w3schools was used to learn and get the necessary code.</p>
</div>


<div class ="box" style="width: 25%;">

<h2>Tutorials</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/"  style="color:white;"> I used the website w3 schools to get tutorials on html, css and javascript </a ></p>


<!--Your implementation page should say what software you used to create your web-pages and
to check them for correctness, e.g. HTML and CSS versions, editor, operating system, browser,
validator, etc.. It should also list the information sources you used. Remember to create hyperlinks
between your implementation page and your home page, and any other pages you
create. You could also hyperlink to the home-pages of the rest of your group, including your
tutor, and to relevant places on the School Moodle site, and so on-->
